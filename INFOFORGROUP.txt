For backend guys (Me, Vig, Malik):
Keep a consistant pipenv. Aways update your pipenvs when install packages but don't bloat it (check if you can do what you need to do with the already install ones before installing another package).
Uses `pip3 install pipenv` to install pipenv. Then use `pipenv install` to install all the dependencies. Remember to push the pipfiles.
